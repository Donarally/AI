# Where do we meet?

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

What are we doing tonight?
Where do we meet?


## Background

Most of the time you waste a lot of time deciding what to do and where to meet when you have to meet with friends.
There is always someone without a car and so you have to pick them up, someone who doesn't want to go somewhere far from home, someone who doesn't like a club.


## How is it used?

Everyone creates their own profile with their tastes, for example:
- I like German beer
- I like pizza
- I prefer not to go downtown
- I love nature
- I hate skating
- I prefer hot to cold
- I have a car
- I like cinema

Someone decides a date, a time and what you want to do (for example a dinner, or we will decide later) and invite friends to the event.
The system, based on date, time, proposal of the creator of the event, preferences of all invited users, offers the best solutions.

## Data sources and AI methods
In addition to the user's preferences, it will be necessary to find the data of most of the entertainments, places, temperatures, categories and everything that can identify a possible activity.

<!--## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
